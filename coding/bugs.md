# bug fixing

## finding and fixing a bug/issue
    VERY RIGOROUSLY analyze the codebase, the described bug, and how the two might be connected. generate a list of potential causes for this issue, including any assumptions made, edge cases, dependencies, race conditions, or data-related issues that might have been overlooked. cross-check code flow, variable states, data types, and external dependencies. think out loud: verify each hypothesis before discarding it. be thorough and think deeply about this: reason for many iterations before concluding your final answer. your goal is accuracy, not speed.   

    IMPORTANT: be extremely detail oriented and always follow OOP best practices. aim for robust, scalable and secure code. if the implementation leaves any important considerations for the future, you MUST be honest and state those explicitly.
    
    double-check all logic, syntax, and edge cases before finishing the task.
