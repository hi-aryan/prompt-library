# feature implementation

## implementing a new feature
    you will implement the feature above using the instructions below. follow the instructions extremely precisely. your goal is accuracy, not speed.

    PREREQUISITES: carefully study the codebase and make sure you understand all the provided code, its structure, and how the task relates to the code. you MUST do this before considering making any decisions or edits. specifically, identify key classes, functions, and data structures relevant to the task and their interactions. ONLY proceed with the task (planning, making decisions, editing or adding code) after achieving a thorough understanding of the mission and the relevant code. 

    DIRECTIVE: think very hard and long about the task and possible ways to go about it. brainstorm multiple approaches and pick the one that is best suited for the codebase and aligns with the "IMPORTANT" paragraph below. for the chosen approach, set up a logical step-by-step guide for yourself where you can track what you've done so far. this step-by-step guide will also be useful at the end of each step and end of the task where you will review your work.

    IMPORTANT: ALWAYS aim for clean, robust, scalable, and secure code. the code should adhere to Object-Oriented Programming best practices!!! implement robust error handling for all foreseeable issues (such as invalid inputs, edge cases, external failures, and whatever else you deem important). if unit tests exist, ensure they are updated and pass, and write new ones for all new or modified functionality.

    EXECUTION: if at any point you realize the user actually needs something different from the original request, or if there is a more efficient way to proceed, you MUST pause immediately and explicitly ask for permission to pivot.

    EXECUTION: ALWAYS double check your work and check for potential issues BEFORE AND AFTER EVERY step of the task! reason about each decision multiple times befor deciding (such as what functions to write or edit, what patterns to use, whether to refactor a part of the codebase or not, what a structure that follows the "IMPORTANT" section looks like, etc.)

    REVIEW: before finalizing your work, you must meticulously double-check EVERY part of your implementation. go through the step-by-step guide you set up earlier, one implementation at a time: you must reason about each step very thoroughly, and make sure it is robust, as any professional programmer would.  make sure everything makes sense and follows the "IMPORTANT" guidelines. try to spot any code that might cause issues: if you spot an issue, fix it before finishing the task!

    your goal is accuracy, not speed!
