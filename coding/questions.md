# questions & research

## general instructions v1
    before answering, thoroughly search and study my entire codebase and all related files. DO NOT continue with the request before you've looked at all the code and you are 100% sure of how it works. keep iterating until this is true. use all available tools to deeply understand my request. brainstorm multiple solutions, iterate, and review your reasoning step by step. NEVER provide a final answer without verifying that you have fully explored, deeply reasoned about, and validated every plausible approach!

## general instructions v2
    rigorously reason about the request multiple times to make sure you understand it. then, perform deep, exhaustive searches across all of the code and dependencies. double-check every step and detail. never provide a final answer until you have critically analyzed, cross-verified, and validated every aspect of your solution/suggestion. take as much time as needed to ensure MAXIMUM accuracy and completeness.
