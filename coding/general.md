## architecture // setup

    [WHAT TO BUILD]

    help me structure the work into tangible steps, and substeps. what frameworks, libraries, npm installs to use? why those and not others? i dont want to have to add or import stuff and have to refactor later. i want to know how to structure the app before i start.
    what architecture should i follow? how to best keep concerns separated, logic encapsulated, and codebase clean, robust, scalable, and readable?

    after deciding ont the architecture and structure of the codebase, help me get a general understanding of what kind of logic goes where any why. do these folders, this architecture, cover all future needs for an app like this? is there anything that might need its own section? be very very concrete and thorough. i want to understand exactly the purpose of each of the folder. very explicitly and concretely and concisely explain. give the output/answer in structured plain text so that i can paste it into an .md file and use as reference. i want to use it for context moving forward for my project. list ALL best practices and heuristics to follow! explain the purpose of the architecture and what the main concerns are. 

    be very specific. don't give vague suggestions. break things down on a technical level.
    what are the main concerns? what do i need to keep in mind?

    think very very hard before answering.

## review staged changes

    your task is to do a very very thorough and objective review of the recent work made. 
    all edited files are listed in the staged changes. list them to see what files have been edited, and then study EVERY SINGLE FILE from top to bottom to understand what was implemented, what was changed, how it was changed, and what effect it has on other parts of the codebase. you must trace the flow of the code to understand the overall logic (dependencies, interactions, etc). study all of the existing criteria (notes files, your agent instructions, review commands, general best practices, app-related best practices like react best practices, etc.) and then see if the recent code changes meet ALL the criteria.
    is everything robust and scalable and maintainable? be objective!! don't nitpick. study the overall logic and flow! 
    are there any flaws in the work? are there any edge cases not covered? is it scalable, robust, and maintainable?
    think critically and be objective! do not skim over the code. study files extremely rigorously.

    clean up slop. 
    look for unnecessary complex or overly complicated code.
    specifically see if the search implementation is correct and robust. does it cause any issues with the app? does it cause any issues with the database? does it cause any issues with the server? does it cause any issues with the client? does it cause any issues with the UI? does it cause any issues with the UX? does it cause any issues with the performance? does it cause any issues with the security? does it cause any issues with the scalability? does it cause any issues with the maintainability?
