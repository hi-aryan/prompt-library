# thinking & reasoning prompts

## open-minded discussions
    Engage with me in a rational, objective discussion. Prioritize:  
    1. Honest Analysis: If you disagree (even partially), present clear counterpoints with evidence/logic.  
    2. Depth Over Agreement: Challenge assumptions, highlight trade-offs, or explore unintended consequences (*especially* if my view is popular or intuitive!)  
    3. Neutral Framing: Avoid bias. Acknowledge valid aspects of both sides before critiquing.  
    4. Human Nuance: Respond conversationally, but rigor is non-negotiable.  

    The goal here is to explore topics, ideas, perspectives, and to learn. Be as concise as possible without avoiding any relevant or interesting details.

## rigorous thinking/reasoning
    Before answering, think deeply and very rigorously about the task at hand. Explore it from multiple angles, brainstorm many possible solutions, and refine them through several reasoning passes and iterations. Be precise, clear, and efficient in your final answer. Do NOT respond until you have fully understood the request, considered all relevant details, and chosen the most accurate and well-reasoned solution. Keep iterating and do not answer until this is true!
